# KVS

`KVS` is a Key-Value Store implementation created as part of the [`Practical Networked Applications in Rust`]([https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/tree/master/rust](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/tree/master/courses/rust)) training course provided by Ping Cap.

The project is currently completed up to project 3.

At the moment, KVS is a single-threaded, persistent key/value store server and client with synchronous networking over a custom protocol.
